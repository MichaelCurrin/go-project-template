# Quickstart
> Manual for getting up and running quickly

The steps here are to install and run the app globally. No Go experienced needed.


## Install

### Download compiled binary

Download a binary from [Releases](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/go-project-template/releases) and add it to a `bin` or Applications directory.

### Build and compile your own

This requires Go to be installed on your machine.

Use this Go CLI command to install globally. This download, compile, and install the app globally in your `GOBIN`.

```sh
$ go get -u github.com/MichaelCurrin/go-project-template
```


## Run

Once in a `bin` directory, you can run the app from anywhere.

```sh
$ go-project-template --name Gopher
Hello, Gopher!
```
