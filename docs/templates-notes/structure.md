# Structure
> Explanining layout that this project follows, which is best practice

- [cmd](/cmd/) - entrypoint. Code can be minimal here.
- [pkg](/pkg/) - code to be imported in other projects (directory is optional).
- [internal](/internal/) - code that is used only for the project.


For more values in [.gitignore](/.gitignore), see [file](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-template/blob/master/.gitignore) of the official template.
