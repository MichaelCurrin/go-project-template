## Clone

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:MichaelCurrin/go-project-template.git
$ cd go-project-template
```


## Install system dependencies

Install Go on your system - see [Install Go](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/dev-cheatsheets/cheatsheets/go/install-go.html) instructions.


## Install project packages

This step is _optional_ as packages will be installed on an initial run.

```sh
$ make install
```

If you need to upgrade all packages to the latest:

```sh
$ make upgrade
```
